# Conway-Game-of-Life-in-C
It's a Simulator for a Math Game developed by John Conway in the 1980's. It can simulate millions of Generations in Seconds(At least on my Mac).

The Game is so cool cause the Rules are so simple, but the Game still is so Complex.
The Game plays on a Board just like a Chess or a Checkers Board, but it doesnt matter how big it is.
Any Field on the Board has two states, it can live or be dead. Here are the four Rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
